in here i am going to test some functionalities of git/github
i have done and fully understood the meaning of the basic command such as
    - git add
    - git commit
    - git remote origin add or git remote set-url origin
    - git branches for creating, managing and merging
    - git checkouts
    - git reset
    - staged files and unstaged files
    - tracking files and untrancking files
    - working directory
    - local repositories and remote repositoreis


Now i am going to continue my learning and i am going to take the main part of the lesson which is how to contribute with other or as group working with in one project.
and also the usage of the branches and how the effect each other working with group.
